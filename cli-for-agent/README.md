# CLI for Agents

Claude Code plugin with a single skill that encodes patterns for **CLIs meant to be driven by coding agents**: non-interactive flags first, layered `--help` with examples, stdin and pipelines, fast actionable errors, idempotency, `--dry-run`, and predictable command structure.

## What it includes

- `cli-for-agents`: design and review guidance for agent-friendly command-line tools

## When to use it

Use when you are building or refactoring a CLI, writing subcommand help, or reviewing whether an existing tool will block agents (interactive prompts, missing examples, ambiguous errors).
