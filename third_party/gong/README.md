# Gong

Claude Code plugin that connects agents to [Gong](https://www.gong.io) through Gong's official hosted [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server.

Pull account summaries, deal insights, and call briefs into chat.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add vramirez/claude-skills
/plugin install gong@claude-skills
```

After installing, set the client ID and secret (below) and complete the Gong sign-in prompt.

## MCP

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gong": {
      "url": "https://mcp.gong.io/mcp",
      "auth": {
        "CLIENT_ID": "${CLIENT_ID}",
        "CLIENT_SECRET": "${CLIENT_SECRET}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Setup

Gong's MCP server uses static OAuth client credentials plus a per-user OAuth login, so an administrator has to register Claude Code before anyone can connect.

1. A Gong technical administrator creates an MCP integration under **Company Settings → Ecosystem → API → Integrations** and enables the MCP scope.
2. Register both redirect URIs on that integration:
   - Desktop: `http://localhost:8787/callback`
   - Web and Cloud Agents: `https://www.cursor.com/agents/mcp/oauth/callback`
3. Claude Code prompts for plugin settings at install time. Set **Gong Client ID** and **Gong Client Secret** from that integration.
4. Complete the Gong OAuth login when Claude Code prompts.

On a team marketplace an admin sets the client ID and secret once for everyone; each member still completes their own Gong OAuth login, so tool calls run with that member's Gong permissions.
