# Meltwater

Claude Code plugin that connects agents to [Meltwater](https://developer.meltwater.com/guides/meltwater-mcp/overview) through Meltwater's official remote [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server.

Search media and social mentions and pull analytics.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add vramirez/claude-skills
/plugin install meltwater@claude-skills
```

After installing, complete the Meltwater sign-in prompt.

## MCP

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "meltwater": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.meltwater.com/v2/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Auth is OAuth. Claude Code prompts for Meltwater sign-in when the plugin connects — there is no client ID or API token to configure.

## Before you connect

You need a Meltwater subscription that includes the Meltwater MCP package. Available tools depend on the products in your subscription.

## What agents can do

| Category | Capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| Your assets | Find saved searches and tags configured in Meltwater |
| Mentions | Retrieve news and social documents for a saved search |
| Analytics | Volume, sentiment, top sources, and themes |
| Queries | Generate a query when no saved search exists |

The hosted runtime is the source of truth for tool names and schemas.

## Notes

- Meltwater's server advertises standard MCP OAuth with dynamic client registration; its public docs still describe API-key auth, but the OAuth flow is live.
- This is Meltwater MCP (`/v2/mcp`), not the higher-level Mira API endpoint at `/mcp`.
