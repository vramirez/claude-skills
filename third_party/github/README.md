# GitHub

Claude Code plugin that connects agents to [GitHub](https://github.com) through GitHub's official remote [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server.

Work with repositories, issues, pull requests, code search, and Actions under the permissions of a personal access token you provide.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add vramirez/claude-skills
/plugin install github@claude-skills
```

After installing, set your GitHub personal access token (below).

## MCP

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Setup

GitHub's remote MCP server authenticates with a **personal access token (PAT)**. Create one, then paste it into the plugin config.

### 1. Create a personal access token

1. Open https://github.com/settings/tokens.
2. Create either a **fine-grained** token or a **classic** token.
3. Grant only the scopes the agent needs. Typical choices:
   - **Repositories / contents** — read or write code and files
   - **Issues** — list, create, and update issues
   - **Pull requests** — list, review, and manage PRs
   - **Actions** — inspect workflow runs (if you want CI access)
   - **Metadata** — always required on fine-grained tokens
4. Set an expiration you are comfortable with, then generate and copy the token.

Prefer a fine-grained token scoped to specific repositories when that is enough. Classic tokens with `repo` are broader and should be treated carefully.

### 2. Configure the plugin

Claude Code prompts for plugin settings at install time. Set **GitHub personal access token** to the value you just created.

Tool calls run with that token's permissions. Rotate or revoke the token from GitHub Settings if it is ever exposed.
