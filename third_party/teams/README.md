# Teams

Claude Code plugin that connects agents to [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams) through Claude Code's remote [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server.

Search chats and channel messages, read conversations, send messages, and react in the signed-in Microsoft account.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add vramirez/claude-skills
/plugin install teams@claude-skills
```

After installing, complete the Microsoft sign-in prompt.

## MCP

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "teams": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.cursor.com/rest-mcp/teams/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Auth is OAuth 2.0 against Microsoft (Entra ID). Claude Code prompts for Microsoft sign-in when the plugin connects. A work or school account is required. Reading channel messages needs tenant admin consent before the plugin can connect.
