# Playwright

Claude Code plugin that connects agents to a real browser through Microsoft's [Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) server.

Navigate pages, click and fill elements, take accessibility snapshots and screenshots, and run end-to-end checks from chat.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add vramirez/claude-skills
/plugin install playwright@claude-skills
```

## Requirements

This is a **local stdio** MCP server. Claude Code launches it with `npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest`, so the machine running Claude Code needs **Node.js** installed and on `PATH`. The `-y` flag skips `npx`'s install confirmation so the first launch cannot hang waiting for interactive input over stdio.

The first run downloads Playwright's browser binaries. That can take a minute and needs network access; later runs reuse the cached browsers.

## MCP

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@playwright/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

No credentials are required. The server runs locally and drives a browser on the same machine.
