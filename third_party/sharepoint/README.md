# SharePoint

Claude Code plugin that connects agents to [Microsoft SharePoint](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/sharepoint/collaboration) through Claude Code's remote [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server.

Search for sites, browse a site's document libraries and folders, search and read files, and read SharePoint lists and list items in the signed-in Microsoft account.

## SharePoint vs. OneDrive

The [OneDrive plugin](../onedrive/) reaches the signed-in user's **personal drive**. This plugin reaches the **sites** the user can access: team and communication sites, their document libraries, and their lists. Install both if you want personal files and team sites covered.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add vramirez/claude-skills
/plugin install sharepoint@claude-skills
```

After installing, complete the Microsoft sign-in prompt.

## MCP

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sharepoint": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.cursor.com/rest-mcp/sharepoint/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Auth is OAuth 2.0 against Microsoft (Entra ID). Claude Code prompts for Microsoft sign-in when the plugin connects.

The plugin is read-only. It requests the delegated `Sites.Read.All` scope, which Microsoft classifies as high-impact, so most work or school tenants require an administrator to consent once before members can connect.
