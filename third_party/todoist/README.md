# Todoist

Claude Code plugin that connects agents to [Todoist](https://www.todoist.com) through Todoist's official remote [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server.

Create, find, update, and complete tasks, and manage projects, sections, labels, and due dates in the signed-in Todoist account.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add vramirez/claude-skills
/plugin install todoist@claude-skills
```

After installing, complete the Todoist sign-in prompt.

## MCP

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "todoist": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://ai.todoist.net/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Auth is OAuth. Claude Code prompts for Todoist sign-in on the first tool call — there is no API key to configure.

## What agents can do

| Category | Capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| Tasks | Create, update, complete, and reopen tasks, including due dates and reminders |
| Projects | Manage projects, sections, and labels |
| Search | `search` and `fetch` tools for finding tasks and pulling their details |
| Comments | Read and add comments on tasks and projects |

The hosted runtime is the source of truth for tool names and schemas.

## Notes

- Tool calls run as the Todoist user who authorizes the connection.
- Doist also publishes an official local server, `@doist/todoist-mcp`, which authenticates with a `TODOIST_API_KEY`. It is worth switching to if you hit session disconnections on the hosted endpoint.
- No Todoist plan tier is required. The paid-plan requirements in Todoist's help articles apply to the AI client, not to Todoist.
