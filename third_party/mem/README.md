# Mem

Claude Code plugin that connects agents to [Mem](https://mem.ai) through Mem's official remote [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server.

Capture, search, and organize notes and collections in Mem using semantic search, straight from the editor.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add vramirez/claude-skills
/plugin install mem@claude-skills
```

After installing, complete the Mem sign-in prompt.

## MCP

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mem": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.mem.ai/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Auth is OAuth. Claude Code prompts for Mem sign-in when the plugin connects.

## What agents can do

| Category | Capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| Notes | Get, list, search, create, update, trash, restore, and delete notes |
| Collections | Create and search collections, and add or remove note membership |
| Attachments | Work with attachments and audio recordings |

The hosted runtime is the source of truth for tool names and schemas.

## Notes

- Tool calls run as the Mem user who authorizes the connection.
- Mem enforces usage quotas. Hitting them returns HTTP 429 with a `UsageQuotaExceeded` or `CommercialUsageLimitRejection` payload.
- An unauthenticated request to the endpoint failing is expected — Mem documents this as normal behaviour, not a broken connection.
