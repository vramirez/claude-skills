# S&P Global

Claude Code plugin that connects agents to [S&P Global](https://docs.kensho.com/llmreadyapi/overview) through S&P Global's official remote [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server.

Query S&P Capital IQ financials, prices, and transcripts.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add vramirez/claude-skills
/plugin install sp-global@claude-skills
```

After installing, complete the S&P Global sign-in prompt.

## MCP

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sp-global": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://kfinance.kensho.com/integrations/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Auth is OAuth. Claude Code prompts for S&P Global sign-in when the plugin connects — there is no client ID or personal access token to configure.

## Before you connect

You need an active S&P Global Market Intelligence subscription or trial for the Kensho LLM-ready API.

## What agents can do

| Category | Capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| Companies | Resolve companies by ticker, ISIN, or CUSIP and read profiles |
| Financials | Statements and 200+ line items from S&P Capital IQ |
| Prices | Historical prices, volumes, market cap, and enterprise value |
| Research | Earnings call transcripts, business relationships, M&A, and estimates |

The hosted runtime is the source of truth for tool names and schemas.

## Notes

- Tool calls run under the S&P Global entitlements of the user who authorizes the connection.
- Kensho also ships the open-source `kensho-kfinance` package for a local server; this plugin uses the hosted server only.
