# Guru

Claude Code plugin that connects agents to [Guru](https://www.getguru.com) through Guru's official remote [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server.

Ask questions against a company's Guru knowledge base and connected sources, get permission-aware answers with citations, and draft or update Guru Cards.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add vramirez/claude-skills
/plugin install guru@claude-skills
```

After installing, complete the Guru sign-in prompt.

## MCP

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "guru": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.api.getguru.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Auth is OAuth 2.0. Claude Code prompts for Guru sign-in when the plugin connects.

## What agents can do

| Category | Capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| Search | Search Guru Cards and connected Sources such as Salesforce, Slack, Google Drive, Confluence, and SharePoint |
| Verified answers | Generate answers through Knowledge Agents, with citations back to the source |
| Cards | Create and update Guru Cards |

The hosted runtime is the source of truth for tool names and schemas.

## Notes

- Tool calls run as the Guru user who authorizes the connection and respect that user's content permissions.
- Guru also accepts an API token, but in an unusual composite form: `Authorization: Bearer [EMAIL]:[TOKEN]`, where the email is the Guru account email and the token comes from **Admin → API Tokens**.
- Guru only supports HTTP streaming, not server-sent events.
- All queries are logged in Guru's AI Agent Center.
